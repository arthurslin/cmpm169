				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>For this experiment we wanted to imitate the train sketch shown in class. 
					https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1754173 by Dave Pagurek.  This sketch was really fascinating because p5js seems like a very simple framework, but a very intricate design was made in this sketch.  We decided to ask ChatGPT, and we asked “make me a tunnel in p5js.” This is what we got.
					
					ChatGPT decided a tunnel was actually a bunch of spinning rectangular prisms.  This sketch was pretty cool so we decided to adapt this to different shapes, and we tried it out with spheres.
					
					We got a bunch of spinning spheres.  What if we could make this look like the solar system?
					</p>

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>Once we got to this step, we decided to make one big sphere in the middle that rotates slowly and a bunch of planets on the outside that rotate faster.  This is what we got.

					ChatGPT helped us with the colors for the planets and it wrote us a helper function to get the colors for the planets.  Unfortunately, this seemed very inorganic because planets have very complex orbit patterns around the sun and rarely rotate on the same plane.  We wanted to utilize random numbers to get the planets to rotate across different planes.
					
					We added phase shifts so the planets would continuously desync from each other's rotation and also an inclination in order to make the planets rotate on different planes.  Once we got to this step, the results were pretty satisfying, but this still didn’t feel like it was enough.  We added some mouse movement to rotate the camera around the objects but it still seemed relatively bland.

				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>We added randomly placed stars in the background and made this sketch really satisfying to play around with.  At the end of the day, this was the satisfaction we were looking for.</p>
