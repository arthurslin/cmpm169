          <h2>Imitate</h2>
          <p>
            We found a piece called Mosaic by andyhaskell which was different
            and interesting which we wanted to imitate for our experiemnt. It
            reminded us of a somewhat pixel art design, so both of us felt that
            this was the piece that resonated with us the most. We started to
            imitate the code and changed the beach image to one of our own,
            which was one of our cats. We were able to do this by changing the
            preload function so that it would show an image that we added.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Integrate</h2>
          <p>
            We began integrating the code by building off the original code. We
            added a global variable to keep track of the size of the dot because
            we wanted to change the size of the dots. We were able to do this by
            implementing a dynamic dot size control. When we were in this
            iteration of the code, we were able to change the image with input
            from the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            We then integrated the next thing we wanted to add to the code,
            which was different shape options. The original only had the option
            for circles so we wanted to add squares, hearts and triangles. We
            did this by creating an array that holds the different shapes and
            then created several draw functions for each of the different
            shapes. We then made it so that once you pressed the p button it
            would toggle between each of the
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Innovate</h2>
          <p>
            Moving onto the innovation steps, we began by implementing a simple
            save feature since we felt that would be an important feature of
            this experiment. We used the S key to save the image in its current
            state.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since we implemented this it only made sense that we could also make
            it possible to load a new image as well. This would give the option
            for whoever uses the program to use whatever image they want to with
            ease. We did this by adding a function tied to the keyboard letter
            I, which is handled by the loadNewImage function which then creates
            a file input element, and the handleFile function handles the
            selected image file. Giving us a working load image function.
          </p>
          <p>
            We then implemented a zoom function, using the z key increases the
            zoom factor, while the x key decreases it.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>For this assignment me and my partner were able to work on everything together really well. We have previously worked together before so we were able to communicate our ideas to each other with ease. I mainly handled the shape toggles and zoom functionality while Pehara handled the saving/loading and the dynamic dot size changer. We both researched for new artwork to reference since both of us had been heavily relying on the library given to us. We really wanted to be able to make something we could be proud of and we both share similar interests and aesthetics towards art. I believe that in this experiment we were able to achieve what we set out to do. We did still encounter some highs and lows. 
			The dynamic dot size implementation was the high for the project, while one of the lows would be dynamic screen size adjustment.  We ended up not implementing it because it was not incredibly urgent. So to conclude, we felt that this experiment was very educational and taught us a lot more about p5js, since we have never worked with images before.
