          <h2>Imitate</h2>
          <p>
            For this assignment, I wanted to imitate the feel that people get
            from watching a hacker in a movie. I think that a lot of movies have
            really goofy hacking scenes so I wanted to take my play on that.
            Here is some inspiration.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Integrate</h2>
          <p>
            For this step, I experimented with javascript chars and randomized
            them to get random ascii characters. Using this line of code:
            chat(random(32,126)) I was able to get any of the possible
            characters that are printable.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also generated a random amount of letters in the block. From here,
            this wasn’t really hacker-like so I experimented more and I wanted
            the text to move from top to bottom. This is what I got. Not really
            what I wanted but I still needed to finely tune my script more. I
            decided to try a different approach and make the letters generated
            separately to get the aesthetic I was looking for. This is what I
            ended up with. I think that this was a pretty big step because it
            was pretty confusing working with the blocks of text.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Innovate</h2>
          <p>
            This wasn’t very hacker-like so I wanted to make the text have
            meaning. I put 0s and 1s in to represent binary and to make it feel
            like the machine is reading the code. I thought long and hard about
            this and I realized that this is way too generic, and it didn't fit
            the vision that I wanted to take for this project. I wanted it to
            represent movie hacking and embrace the goofy factor of it. I
            changed up the vocabulary and took my own spin on it.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            I really enjoyed working on this assignment because I loved the
            mysteriousness of hackers when I was a kid. I thought that it was
            fascinating how people were able to understand computers when I
            thought that they were extremely complex. Now that I have studied
            computer science more, I started to understand a lot more about
            computers. Whenever I watch a movie with hacking in it, I often find
            a lot of the scenes to be really silly, especially older movies.
            Overall, the final product was really satisfying because it
            encompasses what I wanted to build for this experiment.
