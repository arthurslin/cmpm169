          <h2>Imitate</h2>
          <p>
            I was on openprocessing.org and I saw this really cool sketch of a
            spiral that looked like waves. I thought it was pretty cool that a
            lot of art could be generated from spirals. I tried to imitate this,
            and I wanted to learn how to make a simple spiral. Here is my
            spiral. Which created a cool emergent X on the circle it generated.

          <h2>Integrate</h2>
          <p>
            I was thinking of integrating the spiral into a different shape
            using noise. I wanted to generate rippling effects on my canvas. I
            experimented with noise, but I think that this just kind of looked
            like a messy spiral. Maybe it looks like a rose, but I think it
            looks like a tumbleweed. I thought more about what I wanted, and I
            realized I can modify this chaotic behavior to make something,
            somewhat like this explosion.

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Innovate</h2>
          <p>
            I modified the noise function and wanted to see where I could take
            this. This time I ended up with a hairball. I think the points are
            straying too far from each angle, so I realized that I would have to
            take a different approach. So, I ended up using a p5js map, with
            target range being 0 to 2pi degrees. This is what I was looking for!
            I utilized the spiral to make an emergent explosion. I wanted to
            make it have nicer colors, instead of being just red.

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            For this project, I did most of the coding and research by myself.
            However, I used ChatGPT to help me with the colors being used in the
            project. I made sure to comment on the code that I got from chat gpt
            inside of the project on github. I got a small script and modified
            it myself to assist with setting the colors for the page. Other than
            that, this project took me around 2 days to complete and I spent a
            couple of hours each day experimenting. I really struggled with
            using the noise function, as it was not very familiar to me, but
            making a spiral was pretty straightforward. I really enjoyed making
            this project, but for some reason I felt that it wasnâ€™t complex
            enough. I think for my next project, I want to do a deep dive and
            create a more advanced experiment.
