        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Imitate</h2>
          <p>
            For this experiment, there was one way of data visualization that I
            really liked and it was the photos shown as just the primary colors.
            Here is the link. https://shirleywu.studio/travel/

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Integrate</h2>
          <p>
            At first, I thought about the picture(s) that I would input and how
            I would visualize the data that came from the images. I realized
            that I needed to get the pixels of the image and load them into a
            data structure so that manipulation could be done. At first I wanted
            to figure out how I can even access the pixels in a way that they
            could be manipulated. I found out that p5js has both a get and set
            method for image objects. So I was able to get the pixels into an
            array pretty easily. I utilized a double for loop, with the
            parameters of the image.height and the image.width for the looping.
            Each iteration, I would use image.get(i,j) at each iteration and
            push that information into an array.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Innovate</h2>
          <p>
            Now that I had all of the data required in a REALLY big 2d array, I
            thought about sorting the data. I first tried the brightness, but
            that was uninteresting so I decided to sort by the color of the
            image. I created a heuristic to sort the colors by red, then green,
            then blue. The way that I did this was creating an integer for the
            “sorted value” which was the red color multiplied by 1 million, the
            green color multiplied by 1000 and the blue color multiplied by 1.
            The reason that the values are this far apart is because RGB values
            are 3 digits, and we need to account for the max value of 255 in
            order to sort properly. The result is very satisfying. Image on the
            left and result on the right.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            I really liked this assignment because it shows that there are many
            things that can be classified as “data”. Data visualization is a
            very interesting topic and there is a lot of satisfaction to be had.
            Rearranging the pixels of an image was definitely a tough task
            because we are dealing with 100,000 + pixels per image. I think if I
            wanted to take it a step further I would sort by the brightness as
            another heuristic. Currently it is only sorted by the color values,
            so more red = higher value. Overall, I did learn a little more about
            getting information from images and I am going to explore this more
            in a future project.
